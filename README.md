**DATA FAQ**

The team's data came from the MIT MIMIC-III database, a large, freely-available database comprising de-identified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.

The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and mortality (including post-hospital discharge).

MIMIC supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development. It is notable for three factors:
- it is freely available to researchers worldwide
- it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients
- it contains highly granular' data including lab results, vital signs, medications, and more

Due to privacy concerns, our data set was not posted in our GitHub. For reference though, an example medical report has been provided. Should more information be needed, please contact David Scanlan at davidscanlan@berkeley.edu
